CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language that is used to control the presentation of web pages. CSS is used to specify the appearance of HTML elements, such as their font, size, color, and layout.

JS stands for JavaScript. It is a scripting language that is used to add interactivity to web pages. JS can be used to create animations, add event handlers, and make web pages more dynamic.
